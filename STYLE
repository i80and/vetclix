PEP-8 except where otherwise noted:
	- Tab indentation.  No arguments on this point.  Be consistent.
	- 100-column lines, but if readability is not hampered, 79-column is nice.
	- We use Python 3, but many static analyzers still do not recognize its
	  syntax.  Consequently, we try to stick to Python 2 syntax wherever
	  feasible.

Run these regularily.  If your editor has a plugin to run them in realtime,
all the better.
$ pep8 --ignore=W191,E501 *.py
$ pyflakes *.py
$ pychecker --no-override -q *.py
	| From the Python 2 era; complains about modern str() and bytes() usage.
	| --no-override is necessary because Tornado does some conveniently yucky things.
$ pylint --indent-string="\t" --max-line-length=100 *.py
	| pylint is nice, but very noisy.  Try to keep scores above 9.0, but don't
	| sweat it too much.
